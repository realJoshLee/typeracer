# Typing Skills Test
Want a simple tool to try out your typing skills with? This is a simple 1 file type racer. This was a modification from W3Schools to make it have a dark them and to make it more simpler. I don't like the type racing games that others offer so I went out and modified something to make it my own.

Download the file and keep it on your desktop or on a web server to use anywhere.

# Disclaimer
I did not code the type racer. I downloaded the page from W3Schools and changed the style, removed the navigation menus, and other things.
